# Data-analysis-using-SAS-Viya

The	 dataset	 used	 in	 this	 project	 is INSIGHT	 TOY COMPANY 2017,	 which	 can	 be	 found	 in	 the	
available	datasets	of	SAS	Viya.

TASK 1:	Create	data	items.
1.1 Calculate	the	Gross	Margin of	products,	which	is	(Product	Sales – Product	Cost	of	Sales),	and	then	
create	a	new	data	item	for	the	Average Gross	Margin.
1.2 Create	the	Product	Hierarchy including	Brand,	Line,	Make,	Style.
1.3 Create	the	Facility	Geo-hierarchy including	Continent,	Country,	Region,	City.
For each	hierarchical	data	item	generated	in the	sub-tasks 1.2	and 1.3,	create	a	drillable	bar	chart to	
show	average	gross	margin	at	each	level.

TASK 2: Create	visualisations	to	summarise	the	gross	margin	in	2017. 
2.1 Create	 a	 crosstab to	 summarise	 the	 Product	 Sales and	 Gross	 Margin based	 on	 Countries and	
Continents.
2.2 Create	a	visualisation	to	show	which	Country generates	the	highest and	lowest	Gross	Margin.
2.3 Compare	the	Product	Sales over	time	across	all	Continents in	2017.

TASK 3: Create	 ‘interactive’ visualisations to	 explore	 product	 sales	 and	 customer	 satisfaction. 																					
3.1 Create	 a	 drillable	 geo-map to	 compare	 the	 Product	 Sales	 from	 facilities	 across	 Continents,	
Countries,	Regions,	and	Cities.
3.2 Create	and	incorporate	the	Average	Customer	Satisfaction towards	products	 from	each	 facility	
into	the	above	geo-map.
3.3 Create	a	visualisation	(on	the	same	page)	for	the	Product	Sales over	time	in	2017	which	can	be	
adapted/filtered as	we	drill	down	the	above	geo-map.

TASK 4: Build	 one	 report	 page	 to	 help	 the	 global	 production	manager	to	 identify	 the	 correlations	
between	facility	attributes	and	customer	satisfaction.
4.1 Create	a	button	bar to	filter	transactions	by	facilities	from	each Continent and	create	a	bar	chart
to	compare	the	Average Customer	Satisfaction towards	products	from	each	Country.
4.2 Create	 visualisations	 to	 show	 the	 correlations between	 Customer	 Satisfaction and	 Customer	
Distance; the	 distribution	 of	 Customer	Distance; and the Average Customer	 Distance over	 time	 in	
2017.
4.3 Interactively	adapt/filter the	three	visualisations	in	the	sub-task	4.2	by	selecting	each	Country in	
the	bar	chart created	in	the	sub-task	4.1
